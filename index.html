Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

            <div class="content">
              <h3>Familiarize yourself with the equipment. There are generally three things you'll be using: a cue, table, and pool balls. You can probably guess which is what.</h3>
              <p>
    Pick a cue appropriate for your size. Most sticks are 58 inches (147 cm) in length, but shorter and longer ones are available. The tip is the most important part of a cue (it's on the narrow end you'll be hitting with). Tips vary from soft to hard, though inexperienced pool players are best served with a medium to medium-soft tip.
    There are three standard sizes to a pool table: 7, 8, and 9 feet (2.7 m). The Billiard Congress of America defines a "regulation" pool table as any table that is twice as long as it is wide. For example, a 7-foot table is 7 feet (2.1 m) long and 3.5 feet (1.1 m) wide. If you are playing on a smaller table, you may want a shorter cue.
    As for the pool balls, there are evens and odds, solids and stripes, and, most importantly, the 8 ball and the cue ball. The 8 ball is always black. The cue ball is always solid white, a bit heavier, and should be the only ball directly hit during the game.
</p> 
            </div>
          </li>

          <!-- A new step -->
          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <h3> Learn the language. In order to play the game, you have to be able to understand the terminology and rules. Familiarizing yourself with the vocabulary of the game will make it easier and quicker to learn.</h3>
              <p>
    The "break" happens at the beginning of the game when a player breaks up the fifteen pool balls. It is the first shot. Some players break straight on while others break at an angle.
    A scratch occurs when the cue ball jumps off the table or rolls into a pocket. Determine the scratch rules before you start any game.
        It is common for the player who did not receive the scratch to be allowed to place the cue ball anywhere in the "kitchen" upon their subsequent turn. This is the area between the head rail and the head string; or, more simply put, the area between the edge and the second set of diamonds.

              <h3> Get the rules down. For now, let's stick to standard 8-ball. Quite clearly, knowing the rules is the only way to win.</h3>
              <p>
    Use the triangle to "rack up" the 15 pool balls. Different people have different preferences for the set up, but make sure the 8-ball is in the middle.
    A player breaks. If he or she makes a ball into a pocket, he or she claims that type (solid or stripes) for the duration of the game and shoots again. The other player receives the variation they did not claim.
        If the player makes a ball of each variation, they may choose which one they prefer.
    Both players sink all their pool balls into the pockets until just the 8 ball is left. The first player to sink the 8 ball is the winner.
        If a player inadvertently sinks a ball of the other player's, it counts to the other player's benefit.
        If a player inadvertently sinks the 8 ball before all their other balls are in, they lose.
        If a player scratches when shooting for the 8 ball, their turn ends and it is their opponent's turn.
        If a player makes the 8 ball in a pocket but then scratches, they lose.

              <h3>Master the stroke. Each person has a different preferred hand position. If you are right-handed, hold the base of the stick with your right hand and rest the narrow end on your left. If you are left-handed, do the opposite.</h3>
              <p> 
    For a good hand position, try putting your index finger on the top of the stick (curving it) and put your thumb at the bottom of the stick. This is a good, basic way to put your hand in position because you have total control of the stick. Hold it tight as well.
        Some will prefer to rest the stick on their index finger while others may rest the cue in between their fingers in a flatter style. Experiment with a few to see what yields the best results.
        This hand will never move. Only move your back arm when shooting.
    Your feet should be a little wider than shoulder-width apart and at a 45-degree angle.
    During your practice strokes, your eyes should switch from the contact point on the cue ball to the point you're aiming for on the object ball.

              <h3> Make the shots. Line the pool tip up with the cue ball, aim, and hit away! Sounds easy, huh?</h3>
              <p>
    As a beginner, focus on hitting the cue ball straight and with power.
    Aim as if you were to directly hit your object ball. See that spot you'd be hitting if you were allowed to? Alright. Now, aim to get the cue ball to that spot on your object ball.
    Experiment with slow, easy shots. Sometimes a softer touch helps your ball to ride the edge of the table or stay in a more defensive position.
